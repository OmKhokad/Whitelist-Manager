Got it ✅
I’ll prepare a **Clarity smart contract** for a **Whitelist Manager** with only **two functions**, plus a **README.md** containing the sections you mentioned.

---

## **Clarity Contract – Whitelist Manager**

This will have:

1. **add-to-whitelist** – Only contract owner can add an address.
2. **is-whitelisted** – Anyone can check if an address is whitelisted.

```clarity
;; Whitelist Manager Contract
;; A simple contract to manage and verify a list of approved addresses.

;; Owner constant
(define-constant contract-owner tx-sender)

;; Error constants
(define-constant err-owner-only (err u100))
(define-constant err-already-whitelisted (err u101))

;; Whitelist storage (principal → bool)
(define-map whitelist principal bool)

;; Function 1: Add to whitelist (only owner)
(define-public (add-to-whitelist (user principal))
  (begin
    (asserts! (is-eq tx-sender contract-owner) err-owner-only)
    (asserts! (is-none (map-get? whitelist user)) err-already-whitelisted)
    (map-set whitelist user true)
    (ok true)
  )
)

;; Function 2: Check if an address is whitelisted
(define-read-only (is-whitelisted (user principal))
  (ok (default-to false (map-get? whitelist user)))
)
```

## **README.md**

```markdown
# Whitelist Manager

## 1. Project Title
Whitelist Manager Smart Contract

## 2. Project Description
This is a simple Clarity smart contract that allows the contract owner to manage a whitelist of approved blockchain addresses.  
It supports:
- Adding an address to the whitelist (only by the owner)
- Checking if a given address is whitelisted

This is useful for projects that require **access control** such as:
- Token sales with KYC restrictions
- Private NFT minting
- Exclusive feature access for verified users

## 3. Project Vision
The vision of the Whitelist Manager is to provide a **lightweight and secure** access control mechanism on the Stacks blockchain.  
By separating the whitelist logic into its own contract, developers can **reuse and integrate** it with other smart contracts like marketplaces, token issuances, or gated communities.

## 4. Future Scope
- Add bulk address addition for efficiency.
- Implement removal of addresses from the whitelist.
- Add expiration times for whitelist entries.
- Integrate with NFT/token contracts for access-restricted features.
- Include event logging for transparency.

## 5. Contract Address
Deployed contract address (example):
```

ST1234EXAMPLEADDRESS.WHITELIST-MANAGER

```
```

If you want, I can also **add a third function** for **removing from the whitelist** so that the owner can manage it dynamically — but since you said **only two functions**, I kept it minimal.

Do you want me to also **add deployment instructions** in the README so it’s ready for GitHub? That would make it a complete project.
