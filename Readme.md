## 1. Project Title
Whitelist Manager Smart Contract

## 2. Project Description
This is a simple Clarity smart contract that allows the contract owner to manage a whitelist of approved blockchain addresses.  
It supports:
- Adding an address to the whitelist (only by the owner)
- Checking if a given address is whitelisted

This is useful for projects that require **access control** such as:
- Token sales with KYC restrictions
- Private NFT minting
- Exclusive feature access for verified users

## 3. Project Vision
The vision of the Whitelist Manager is to provide a **lightweight and secure** access control mechanism on the Stacks blockchain.  
By separating the whitelist logic into its own contract, developers can **reuse and integrate** it with other smart contracts like marketplaces, token issuances, or gated communities.

## 4. Future Scope
- Add bulk address addition for efficiency.
- Implement removal of addresses from the whitelist.
- Add expiration times for whitelist entries.
- Integrate with NFT/token contracts for access-restricted features.
- Include event logging for transparency.
